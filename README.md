# What is this?
The NERD (NoisE Removal Database) is a collection of implemented research papers for open use by the S&P denoising research community.
> A single database of 100+ research papers in the noise removal subsection of Image processing. Any individual in the Image noise removal community can use standardized implementations of state-of-the-art techniques for his/her own work. This further improves the overall time to market of the research work and promotes transparency between fellow researchers.
## Why a monolith repo?
Let me know if you have a better suggestion! It just seemed convinient at the time.
